# Next.js | TypeScript | Tailwind CSS - Starter Template 🚀

Kickstart your Next.js project with this ready-to-use template. It includes everything you need to build a modern website or web app.

I found myself configuring a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS every time I wanted to start a new project. So I decided to create a template that I can use as a starting point.

It is very minimal with a few examples inculded for those who are new to this stack. You can also find useful learning resources in the [Learn More](#learn-more) section below.

Hope you find it useful! 🙌

## What's included in this template?

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Beautiful ✨Typographic defaults for HTML✨ elements using [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin)
- Automatic ✨Tailwind Class Sorting✨ with Prettier using [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier)
- Simple components/pages examples (delete them if you want):
  - Layout, Header, Footer and Counter example components
  - Index, 404 and two extra example pages

The template uses yarn as the package manager. If you prefer npm, you can delete the `yarn.lock` file and run `npm install` instead to generate a new `package-lock.json` file.

If you need something more complex for your application than this starter, I recommend checking out: [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
